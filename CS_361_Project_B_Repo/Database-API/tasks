For cycle one, I think we basically just need some way to persist user preferences.
If we don't want any Internet connections beyond the API requests to spoonacular,
I think SQLite3 in the Android app would be best.  That way, each user would have
his/her own database on the Android device - no worries about managing user accounts,
maybe just one table with a few columns to capture preferences.

I've never done this before...but it seems that SQLite3 is a thing in Android development.

Android project structure/building/running/emulation doesn't work here on c9.io
as far as I know, but I can look into these issues,
  SQLite3 and WebView,
and upload files for you to review here.
