Meal Planner Test Cases:

1) Does the meal planner generate recipe lists within the max calories calculated from the Calorie Calculator?
    -Obtain calories for each ingredient item in each recipe, add calories in the weekly recipies.
    -Ensure that the calorie total in weeky recipies meet the weekly calorie limit.

2) Are the meal plans varied?

    Goal: Supply a varied meal plan (not always chicken/veggies)
    
    Metrics:
        - Numbers of different proteins / week (at least 2 unique?)
        - Number of different veggies / week (at least 3 unique?)
        - Number of different sides / week (at least 3-4 unique?)
        - Number of meals generated / day == 3 
     
3) Do the meal plans fit the dietary preferences?

4) Do the API requests work?
    -Verify API http is sending the correct parameters
    -Verify API JSON object contains expected information
    -What happens if API http call fails? How does the program handle this failure. 

5) Can the user request new recipes?

6) Can the user regenerate a whole new meal plan?
