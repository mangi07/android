To test out this template that I created in Android Studio,
unzip "latest.zip" and open it in Android Studio as an existing project.

Also, you can set the minimum SDK as low as Android 2.3 (Gingerbread).

I created this project with minimum SDK Android 2.3,
and tested it on a real device running Android 2.3.6
and in an emulator running Android 4.4.2

I'm guessing that based on my testing, the project should demonstrate AJAX 
working as shown in the "screenshots" folder.

So with this, I believe we could keep on developing in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
and put the files in assets/www of the Android app periodically to test it out.
So the client gets the mobile app and yet we can keep writing in JavaScript:)
